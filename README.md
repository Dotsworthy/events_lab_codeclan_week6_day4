# Events lab CodeClan Week6 Day4
based on the following brief:

Your task is to create a Reading List app that allow a user to submit items they intend to read later and view them on the page. Using the start code, which has the html and css already provided, you will need to handle the form's submission and display the submitted details on the page.

## MVP
The provided html form has the following fields:

1. Title - text input
2. Author - text input
3. Category (e.g. book, article, blog post) - select

Once the user has submitted the form, the reading list item's details should be displayed below and the form's fields should reset to empty. Each time the user submits the form, the new reading list item should be added to the display.
